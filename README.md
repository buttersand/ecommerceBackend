# Ecommerce Backend Microservices

This repository contains the backend services for an ecommerce application, built using TypeScript, Node.js, and a microservice architecture.

## Architecture

The application is structured as a set of independent microservices, each responsible for a specific domain:

* **Product Service:** Manages product information, inventory, and related operations.
* **User Service:** Handles user authentication, registration, profiles, and permissions.
* **Order Service:** Processes orders, manages payments, and handles shipping.
* **Cart Service:** Manages user shopping carts.
* **Payment Service:** Handles payment processing.
* **Shipping Service:** Manages shipping and delivery.

This architecture allows for:

* **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently based on its load.
* **Maintainability:** Smaller, focused services are easier to maintain and update.
* **Fault Isolation:** Failures in one service do not affect the entire application.
* **Technology Diversity:** Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack.

## Technologies

* **Node.js:** Runtime environment.
* **TypeScript:** Programming language for type safety.
* **Express.js:** Web framework.
* **MongoDB.
* **Axios/Fetch:** HTTP client.
